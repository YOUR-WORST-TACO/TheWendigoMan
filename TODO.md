# project todo list

## Robyn projects

- adjust sass component imageFlex to order index items in a grid.
- make grid adjustable ie: images per row, spacing between images, border radius etc, use sass variables.
- brainstorm some possible site layouts for peer review and discussion.
- develop a sort function in artworkifier that sorts art files based on the following:
    - consider either portrait style or landscape style images as x where x is the least common of the two and y is the most common of the two.
    - x does not like to touch images of itself when the ratio between x and y is less than 3/4
    - x should be evenly distributed with a 25% margin of random placement.
- develop a sort function in artworkifier that sorts art files based on publishDate
    - should be easy
